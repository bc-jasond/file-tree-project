HTML to DOM tree viewer
============================

- used Koa for simple upload endpoint (this took me way too long)
- `node backend/api.js` to start server on localhost:3000
- picked an ES6/angular 1.x starter project based on TodoMVC (probably should have just started with my current project and removed extra tools/features.  The sample project ended up being unfamiliar and wasted time)
- `gulp start` to start frontend on localhost:3001
- was going to use `angular-tree-control` library + styling to match image
